> This is a quick calculation for a regular operation. Fine tuned planning will be needed for high intensive fleet needs such as distributions or water trucking. 

## From Analysis to Numbers: How Many Vehicles Do You Actually Need?

After analyzing your needs, the next logical question is: "Do we have the right *number* of vehicles?" This guide provides two core methods to calculate a baseline fleet size.

These formulas provide a quantitative starting point. Remember to always combine these numbers with the "Reality Check" factors outlined at the end.

### Step 1: Quantify Your Operational Demand

Before you can calculate, you must define the demand you are trying to meet.

#### For Goods (Cargo):
- **Total Tonnage/Volume:** How much aid (in kg or m³) do you need to move per week or per month?
- **Frequency of Delivery:** How often must deliveries be made to each key location?

#### For People (Personnel):
- **Number of Staff:** How many team members require daily transport?
- **Movement Patterns:** Do staff move as a group (e.g., a field team to a site), or do they have individual travel needs? Identify the point of **peak demand**—the time when the most people need to move simultaneously.

#### For Human Resources:
- **Driver Availability:** How many licensed and trained drivers do you have on staff?
- **Operational Hours:** What are the standard working hours for your drivers and programs? This is a critical input for the formulas below.

### Step 2: The Quantitative Core - Calculating Your Fleet Size

Choose the method that best fits the primary purpose of your fleet.

#### Method 1: Capacity-Based Calculation (for Cargo)
*This method, adapted from best practices like the CARE Emergency Toolkit, is ideal for operations focused on delivering goods.*

**The Formula:**
$$
\text{Number of Vehicles} = \frac{\text{Total Tonnes to be Moved}}{\text{Vehicle Capacity (tonnes)} \times \text{Number of Possible Trips per Period}}
$$

**Where:**
- `Total Tonnes to be Moved` is your total cargo need for the planning period (e.g., a month).
- `Vehicle Capacity` is the maximum payload of your vehicle type.
- `Number of Possible Trips per Period` is a sub-calculation:
  $$
  \text{Trips per Day} = \frac{\text{Operational Hours per Day}}{\text{Round Trip Time (incl. loading/unloading)}}
  $$
  Then, multiply `Trips per Day` by the number of operational days in your period.

::card
**Example:**

You must move **100 tonnes** of food aid in a month (20 working days).
- Your trucks have a capacity of **5 tonnes**.
- A round trip takes **4 hours**.
- Your operational day is **8 hours**.

1.  **Trips per Vehicle per Day:** 8 hours / 4 hours = **2 trips**
2.  **Trips per Vehicle per Month:** 2 trips/day × 20 days = **40 trips**
3.  **Number of Trucks Needed:** 100 tonnes / (5 tonnes/trip × 40 trips) = **0.5 trucks**

**Conclusion:** One truck is sufficient and would be utilized for 50% of the month for this specific task.

#### Method 2: Demand-Based Calculation (for Personnel)
*This method is best for calculating needs for transporting staff.*

**The Formula:**
$$
\text{Number of Vehicles} = \frac{\text{Peak Personnel Movement Demand}}{\text{Vehicle Seating Capacity}}
$$

**Where:**
- `Peak Personnel Movement Demand` is the maximum number of people needing transport at the same time.
- `Vehicle Seating Capacity` is the number of available passenger seats (excluding the driver).

::card
**Example:**

A team of **12 field officers** needs to travel to a site together each morning.
- Your vehicles are standard 4x4s with **4 passenger seats**.

1. **Number of Vehicles Needed:** 12 people / 4 seats/vehicle = **3 vehicles**

**Conclusion:** You need to dispatch 3 vehicles every morning for this peak movement.

### Step 3: The Reality Check - Adjusting for the Real World

**Calculations provide a baseline, not the final answer.** Field realities demand flexibility and buffers.

#### The Maintenance Factor (Downtime)
Vehicles need routine maintenance and break down unexpectedly. A vehicle in the workshop is a vehicle that cannot be used.
- **Rule of Thumb:** Add a **10-25% buffer** to your calculated fleet size to ensure operational continuity. For every 10 vehicles your calculations require, you should have 1-2 spare vehicles available.

#### The Insecurity Multiplier
Operating in high-risk zones adds constraints that impact fleet size.
- **Movement Restrictions:** Curfews and checkpoints can drastically reduce your daily operational hours, affecting the "Trips per Day" calculation.
- **Convoy Requirements:** Security protocols often require a minimum of two vehicles per movement, even if only one is carrying cargo. This can instantly double your vehicle needs for key routes.

#### The Surge Factor (Unpredictable Demand)
The humanitarian context is volatile. A sudden displacement or disaster can dramatically increase transport needs overnight.
- **Contingency Planning:** You cannot afford a fleet for every worst-case scenario. Instead, have a plan. This should include pre-agreed terms with local, vetted vehicle rental companies to allow for rapid scaling.

#### The "Last Mile" Challenge
The final leg of a journey is often the most difficult, with poor roads or infrastructure.
- **Fleet Diversification:** Your calculations might suggest you need two large trucks, but the reality might be that you need one large truck for the main road and three smaller 4x4s or motorcycles to reach the final destinations. Ensure your fleet mix matches the terrain.
