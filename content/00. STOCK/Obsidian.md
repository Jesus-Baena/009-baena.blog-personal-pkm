I have been using Obsidian for a couple of years now. I use it as a Personal Information Management (PIM) system, as a Project repository and as [[Personal Knowledge Management]] (PMS) system. 

This blog is a subset of my complete Obsidian setup. This is a screenshot of how it looks like.

I have tried many other systems: Notion, Heptabase, Logsec, Anytype... All fine solutions, but I always end up returning to Obsidian. 

For the **Syncing** of my notes across devices, I am using the official service provided by Obsidian. Paradoxically, the place where I develop my self-hosted projects, is not selfhosted. 

For the **Publishing** of this blog, I am using an open source project [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). I only made minor changes that can be copied on [my public repository](https://github.com/Jesus-Baena/009-baena.blog-personal-pkm) on GitHub. I have changed the footer and the filtering of the explorer. 

For the **Hosting**, I am using Cloudflare Pages. The easiness of deployment using Workers is unbeatable. I commit to my GitHub repository and automatically is picked up by the Cloudflare Worker to build and serve.
