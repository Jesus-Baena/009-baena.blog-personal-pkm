I have been using Obsidian for a couple of years now. I use it as a Personal Information Management (PIM) system, as a Project repository and as [[Personal Knowledge Management]] (PMS) system. 

This blog is a subset of my complete Obsidian setup. This is a screenshot of how it looks like.

I have tried many other systems: notion, heptabase, Logsec, Anytype. All fine solutions, but I always end up returning to Obsidian.
