> [!CONCEPT] Concept
> A digital garden is an online space where individuals can cultivate and connect their thoughts, ideas, and knowledge over time. It is like a personal wiki or a connected notebook that grows and evolves as the creator learns.
> 
> Unlike a traditional blog, a digital garden consists of interconnected notes, essays, and resources that are perpetually a work in progress. The focus is less on polished, finished articles and more on the process of learning and developing ideas in public


The main differences with a [[Personal Blog]] is typically organized in reverse chronological order, with the newest posts appearing first. The content is usually presented as complete and polished articles, sharing personal experiences, stories, and opinions. The nature of a blog is often more performative, aiming to present a finished product to an audience.

In contrast, a **digital garden** is structured around interconnected ideas, often using links to connect related notes This creates a web of knowledge that can be explored in a non-linear way. The content in a digital garden is evergreen, meaning it is continuously updated and refined over time. **It embraces a *"work-in-progress"* approach**, where ideas can be shared in their early stages and developed openly. The primary purpose of a digital garden is often for the creator's own learning and exploration, rather than performance.

Here's a summary of the key differences:
