### **1.2. Donor Compliance Essentials for Fleet Management**

Meeting donor requirements is non-negotiable. While specific rules vary, most major institutional donors (e.g., USAID, ECHO, FCDO, UN agencies) share common principles rooted in accountability and Value for Money (VfM).

**1.2.1. Understanding Common Donor Requirements & Expectations**

- **Asset Management:** Donors require that vehicles purchased with their funds are managed as specified in the grant agreement. This includes proper branding, ensuring use is restricted to project activities, and following correct disposal procedures at the end of the project. Details of these requirements are integrated along these guidelines. 
    
- **Allowable Costs:** Only reasonable and necessary costs are chargeable to the grant. This means you must be able to justify expenses for fuel, maintenance, and insurance. Costs deemed excessive due to negligence (e.g., repairs from an accident caused by reckless driving) may be disallowed.
    
- **Documentation & Verifiability:** Every transaction and vehicle movement must be supported by clear documentation. This is the most critical area for compliance. Key documents include:
    
    - Vehicle Logbooks (showing date, times, odometer readings, purpose of trip, driver, passengers).
    - Fuel Logs and Receipts.
    - Maintenance Job Cards and Invoices.
    - Procurement Records for parts and services.
        
- **Reporting:** Donors often require periodic reports on asset status, including vehicle condition and utilization rates.
    

**1.2.2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Donor Reporting** Being able to report on key metrics demonstrates effective management. Consider tracking the following:

- **Cost per Kilometer/Mile:** Total operating cost รท Total distance traveled. This is a primary VfM indicator.
- **Fuel Efficiency:** Kilometers per Liter (or Miles per Gallon). Helps identify mechanical issues or inefficient driving.
- **Utilization Rate:** Actual operating days รท Total potential operating days. Shows if vehicles are being used effectively or sitting idle.
- **Availability Rate:** (Total potential operating days - Downtime days) รท Total potential operating days. Shows fleet reliability.
- **Accident/Incident Rate:** Number of accidents per 100,000 km. A key safety indicator.
    

**1.2.3. General Donor Compliance Checklist for Fleet Operations** Use this checklist as a quick reference to gauge your compliance level:

- [ ] Is there a clear, written policy governing the use of all vehicles?
- [ ] Is every trip documented in a vehicle logbook with sufficient detail (date, purpose, odometer, etc.)?
- [ ] Is every instance of refueling documented with quantity, cost, and odometer reading?
- [ ] Are all vehicle-related expenses (maintenance, repairs, insurance) supported by invoices and proper procurement documentation?
- [ ] Are vehicles used exclusively for official, project-related activities as per the relevant grant agreement?
- [ ] Are vehicles properly branded according to donor requirements?
- [ ] Is there a system for regular vehicle inspections to ensure safety and roadworthiness?
- [ ] Are procedures for vehicle disposal at the end of a project clearly defined and followed?
    

Addressing any "no" answers in this checklist should be a top priority.
