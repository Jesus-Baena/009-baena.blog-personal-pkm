# [[B. HUMANITARIAN SECTOR EMPLOYMENT DASHBOARD]]

The Humanitarian Sector Employment Dashboard is a Business Intelligence Demo designed to provide a dynamic and near real-time overview of the hiring landscape within the aid community. By automatically sourcing and refreshing data every four hours from the [ReliefWeb Jobs API](https://apidoc.reliefweb.int/), it visualizes key metrics such as the top hiring organizations, the distribution of roles across different career categories and the required experience levels for available positions.
