> Let this be a chilling reminder. There is only one way of achieve personal Digital Sovereignty, and this is ==self-hosting on premises==. 

It is unavoidable to depends on third parties. I benefit from cloud providers for the Docker Swarm infrastructure that I am building. It is needed to create High Availability.  But let us reminder that is not best practice to depends on one single provider. Some providers are unreliable, unreachable, and this is where our data lives. 

This is also the main reason for what I have invested in a robust [[Home Office Infrastructure]]. At anytime, to be able to access our data and our client's data is non-negotiable.
