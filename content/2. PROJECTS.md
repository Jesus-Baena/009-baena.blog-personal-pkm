# [[A. FIELD MANAGEMENT KIT]]

The Field Management Kit is a curated collection of practical tools for field management and coordination. It is a living project, where I adapt and refine solutions developed over fourteen years of my own field work, making them accessible for broader use. My goal is to help others benefit from this experience so they don't have to reinvent the wheel.


# [[B. HUMANITARIAN SECTOR EMPLOYMENT DASHBOARD]]

The Humanitarian Sector Employment Dashboard is a Business Intelligence Demo designed to provide a dynamic and near real-time overview of the hiring landscape within the aid community. By automatically sourcing and refreshing data every four hours from the [ReliefWeb Jobs API](https://apidoc.reliefweb.int/), it visualizes key metrics such as the top hiring organizations, the distribution of roles across different career categories and the required experience levels for available positions.
