title: Welcome to my Blog
---
Welcome to my digital garden, a space that merges my [[Personal Blog]] with my [[Personal Knowledge Management]] system. Expect a dynamic collection of opinions, drafts, raw notes, and ramblings.

If you're interested in my professional work, my portfolio at [jbaena.net](https://jbaena.net) offers an orderly repository of projects, primarily focused on Humanitarian Work, Data Analysis, and AI. This blog, in contrast, reveals the day-to-day process and thinking behind that work.

###### **[[1. POSTs]]** 
A general collection of my self-contained thoughts, spanning a wide variety of topics and categories.
###### **[[2. TECH]]**
A repository of technical notes and reminders about the tools I use. You might find a helpful tutorial or solution for a problem you're facing.
###### **[[3. PROJECTS]]**
Follow the development of my current projects here. You can find the finished work at [jbaena.net](https://jbaena.net), but this is where I share the inner workings and processes for you to explore and adapt.
###### **[[4. INTERNET]]**
This section serves as my personal dashboard for tracking and consolidating my online presence.

This blog is a natural extension of my daily work within [[Obsidian]]. Since I already use it constantly, this site is just a curated window into my private knowledge vault. The unique clunkiness, block-based feel of this space is a direct result of the Obsidian interface it's built upon.
