title: Welcome to my Blog

Welcome to my site, a space that merges my [[Personal Blog]] with my [[Digital Garden]]. Expect a dynamic collection of opinions, drafts, raw notes, and ramblings.

If you're interested in my professional work, my portfolio at [jbaena.net](https://jbaena.net) offers an orderly repository of projects, primarily focused on Humanitarian Work, Data Analysis, and AI. This site, in contrast, reveals the day-to-day process and thinking behind that work.

A general collection of my self-contained thoughts, spanning a wide variety of topics and categories. This is the *bloggy* part of this site. 
###### **[[2. TECH]]**, **[[3. PROJECTS]]**, **[[4. ABOUT]]**
This spaces serves as a dynamic repository for my work and digital presence. Here, you'll find a collection of my technical notes and tutorials, offering potential solutions to challenges you might be facing. It also provides a look into the inner workings and development processes of my current projects, with the finished pieces accessible [at jbaena.net](https://jbaena.net)

This space is a natural extension of my daily work within [[Obsidian]]. Since I already use it constantly, this site is just a curated window into my private knowledge vault. The unique clunkiness, block-based feel of this space is a direct result of the Obsidian interface it's built upon.
