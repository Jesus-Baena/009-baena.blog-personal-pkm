## The 2-Hour Fleet Assessment: Your Starting Point

Before you can improve your fleet, you must first understand what you have. Think of this as a doctor's initial diagnosis before prescribing a treatment.

This guide provides a simple, rapid process to get a high-level snapshot of your fleet's status, challenges, and immediate risks. The goal is not to have perfect data, but to establish a solid baseline in just a few hours.

### Step 1: The Paper Trail (What do we *think* we have?)

Start at your desk. Your first task is to gather all existing documents related to your vehicles. Don't worry if they are disorganized or incomplete—the gaps are just as important as the information you find.

**Your Checklist:**
- [ ] **Vehicle List:** Is there a central list or spreadsheet of all vehicles?
- [ ] **Ownership & Registration Documents:** Find the legal papers for each vehicle.
- [ ] **Insurance Policies:** Locate the current insurance certificates. Note the expiry dates.
- [ ] **Rental or Lease Agreements:** For any non-owned vehicles, find the contracts.
- [ ] **Maintenance Records:** Are there any files, logbooks, or invoices from recent repairs?
- [ ] **Fuel Invoices:** Gather a few recent fuel bills to understand consumption patterns.

*Tip: Create a simple pile or folder for each vehicle to keep things organized.*

### Step 2: The Physical Count (What do we *actually* have?)

Now, walk outside with your clipboard or notebook. Your goal is to physically verify the fleet against your paper trail.

**Your Checklist:**
- [ ] **Count and Identify:** Match each vehicle to its registration document. Note any vehicles on the list that are missing, or any that are present but not on the list.
- [ ] **Quick Condition Check:** You are not doing a full mechanical inspection. Look for obvious issues: visible body damage, flat or worn tires, broken lights, missing mirrors.
- [ ] **Check for Branding:** Are the vehicles correctly marked with your organization's logo according to policy?
- [ ] **Essential Safety Equipment:** Check for the presence and condition of:
  - First Aid Kit
  - Fire Extinguisher (check expiry date)
  - Spare Tire and Jack
- [ ] **Note the Odometer Reading:** Record the current mileage for each vehicle.

### Step 3: The People (Who is involved?)

A fleet is managed and operated by people. Identify the key personnel.

**Your Checklist:**
- [ ] **List of Drivers:** Who is authorized to drive?
- [ ] **Driver's Licenses:** Confirm that you have a file with a valid license copy for each driver.
- [ ] **Identify the Focal Point:** Who is the person everyone goes to with vehicle problems? Is it a formal Fleet Manager, a Logistics Officer, or someone acting in an unofficial capacity?

### Step 4: Synthesize Your Findings into a "One-Page Snapshot"

You've gathered the data. Now, summarize it into a single, concise document. This **One-Page Fleet Snapshot** is your foundational report.

**Create a document with these headings:**

- **Total Fleet Size:** e.g., "8 vehicles total."
- **Composition:** e.g., "4 owned Land Cruisers, 2 rented Hilux, 2 motorcycles."
- **Overall Condition:** e.g., "Generally fair, but 2 vehicles have significant body damage."
- **Documentation Status:** e.g., "Insurance expired on one vehicle. Registration missing for another."
- **Immediate Red Flags:** e.g., "No central maintenance records exist. No fire extinguishers in 3 of 8 vehicles."
- **Key Personnel:** e.g., "8 authorized drivers. Logistics Officer is the informal fleet focal point."
- **Quick Wins:** e.g., "Renew expired insurance. Purchase missing safety equipment."
