## Our Guiding Principles

Underpinning every policy, procedure, and tool in this kit are five core principles. They are the "why" behind the "how" of effective and responsible NGO fleet management.

### 1. Accountability & Transparency
*Ensuring every resource is used responsibly, with clear records and verifiable oversight.*

- **In practice, this means:**
  - Maintaining accurate and complete records for every journey, fuel fill, and maintenance action.
  - Defining clear roles and responsibilities for drivers, managers, and logistics staff.
  - Conducting regular internal audits to ensure compliance and identify gaps.
  - Providing transparent reports to donors and stakeholders on fleet performance and costs.

### 2. Efficiency & Value for Money (VfM)
*Achieving your mission's goals in the most economical way, without compromising quality or safety.*

- **In practice, this means:**
  - Implementing smart journey planning to consolidate trips and optimize routes.
  - Prioritizing preventive maintenance to avoid costly breakdowns and extend vehicle life.
  - Monitoring fuel consumption and vehicle performance to identify and address inefficiencies.
  - Using data to make informed decisions about vehicle selection, replacement, and allocation.

### 3. Safety & Security
*Placing the well-being of your people and the security of your assets above all else.*

- **In practice, this means:**
  - Mandating comprehensive driver training, including defensive and context-specific driving techniques.
  - Enforcing regular vehicle safety checks (e.g., daily inspections) and adherence to traffic laws.
  - Establishing robust communication protocols and journey risk assessments for all movements.
  - Ensuring secure parking, asset tracking, and clear procedures for accidents and incidents.

### 4. Sustainability (Operational & Environmental)
*Building systems that last while minimizing your environmental footprint.*

- **In practice, this means:**
  - Promoting fuel-efficient driving habits and maintaining vehicles to reduce emissions.
  - Establishing procedures for the responsible disposal and recycling of vehicles, parts, and fluids.
  - Considering greener vehicle options where context and budget allow.
  - Building local capacity to ensure that fleet management systems can be maintained effectively over the long term.

### 5. Adaptability & Contextualization
*Recognizing that the best system is one that is tailored to your specific local reality.*

- **In practice, this means:**
  - Using this kit as a guide and a template—not a rigid set of unbreakable rules.
  - Critically assessing and modifying procedures to fit local laws, security situations, and infrastructure.
  - Choosing the right tier and tools for the local environment, especially regarding internet connectivity.
  - Fostering a culture of continuous learning and adapting practices based on real-world field experience.
